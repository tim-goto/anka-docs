  Using Apple's Metal/GPUs inside of your Anka VMs.
---

{{< hint warning >}}
The host macOS should always be either newer or the same version as VMs running PG to avoid incompatibilities between the Apple metal APIs. We also recommend the latest Big Sur or higher versions.

### Intel

With Intel machines, Apple has included paravirtualized graphics support in Big Sur which allows us to support graphics acceleration/GPUs inside of Anka VMs.

To enable this feature, you'll need to:

1. Ensure your host is Big Sur (or higher)
2. Ensure your VM is using Big Sur (or higher)
3. Set the display for the VM with `anka modify {vmName} set display -c pg`

### ARM

For ARM, PG is enabled by default.
