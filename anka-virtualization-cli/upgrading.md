### Upgrade Procedure

#### [1. Download and install the latest version]({{< relref "anka-virtualization-cli/getting-started/installing-the-anka-virtualization-package.md" >}})

#### 2. Upgrade VM addons

If your existing version is noted in the [Pre-Upgrade Considerations]({{< relref "intel/upgrading.md#pre-upgrade-considerations" >}}) as requiring an addons upgrade, or, if you're going between major/minor versions of Anka:

   1. Upgrade the guest addons inside existing VM templates with `anka start -vu`. This opens the VM desktop in a viewer window and allows you to manually launch and install the addons package.
   2. Push the newly upgraded VM templates to registry with `anka registry push {vmNameOrUUID} --tag <newTag>`
