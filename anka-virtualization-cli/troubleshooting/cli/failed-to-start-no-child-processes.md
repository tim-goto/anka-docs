## Common Causes

1. 2.5 was installed previously.
2. You are logged into the machine with 1 user, then SSHing in as another.
3. Your anti-virus is blocking the processes from starting.

## Solutions

1. Re-install 2.5 and run `sudo /Library/Application\ Support/Veertu/Anka/tools/uninstall.sh`.
2. Log into the UI with the user you're using for SSH.
3. Disable all anti-virus software.
