## Scenario

When running a VM, the time inside seems to drift by several seconds or minutes slow or fast.

## Common Causes

1. This is a problem with VM templates created on different hardware. For example, you create the VM templates on Mac Pros, but then run them on Mac Minis.

## Solution

Create and run your VMs on the same hardware they were created on.
