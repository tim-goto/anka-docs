## Commercial Licenses

> Commercial Anka licenses are issued for yearly license subscription which includes updates, upgrades, and standard support. They can be purchased for a single year or multiple years.

> Commercial licenses are automatically extended in activated Anka software if days to expiration is < 30 days. The machine where you've installed Anka must have a connection to the licensing server.

### Pricing

+ **Anka Build (Intel)** - Cost is core based. For example, if you are setting up a cloud consisting of 2, 8-core Intel processor mac minis, then total core count will be 8 cores. For very large core count, there are other licensing models.

+ **Anka Flow (Intel)** - Cost is per machine. For example, if you are installing Anka Flow on 10 developer machines, then quantity will be 10.

+ **Anka Build (Apple Silicon)** - Pricing model is host-based and not core based. Due to the complexity of core-based licensing with new Apple Silicon-based hardware, we are changing the licensing model to host-based licensing.

<!-- + **Anka Build (Apple Silicon)** - Cost is performance core based. For example, 8-core Apple processor mac mini had 4 performance cores. if you are setting up a cloud consisting of 2, 8-core Apple processor mac minis, then total performance core count will be 8 cores. For very large core count, there are other licensing models. For M1 Max and M1 Ultra machines, contact us for pricing information. -->
