## MacOS installation through the `anka create` command is now automated

Anka 3.0.x began Anka's support for Apple Silicon / M1 / ARM virtualization. However, it was significantly different from the Anka 2/Intel version which produced a VM, using `anka create`, with macOS installed, the user set up, and SIP disabled. Users had to manually install macOS and perform any other necessary steps before their VM was functional.

Starting in Anka 3.1, we're the first to solve this problem by automating the macOS installation, setup, and disabling of SIP. We even automatically enable VNC so users can work around the limitations in Anka View (doesn't work under `sudo`). We're excited about this release and look forward to it improving your production environments running Apple Silicon VMs.
