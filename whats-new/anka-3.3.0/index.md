We are very excited to announce Anka Virtualization 3.3.0. In this version, you're going to find several important features that all of our users will benefit from. Here is a summary:

1. [Combined ARM and Intel PKG Installers](#combined-arm-and-intel-pkg-installers)
2. [VM Networking IP Filtering](#vm-networking-ip-filtering)

## Combined ARM and Intel PKG Installers

Customers will now find a single PKG installer for both Intel and ARM. Existing download URLs will remain the same, however, you will no longer be able to rely on the `-intel` and `-arm` suffixes on the PKG file.

## VM Networking IP Filtering
