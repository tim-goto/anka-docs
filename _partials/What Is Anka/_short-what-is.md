Veertu's Anka is a suite of software for creating and managing macOS VMs in a container-like way, running on top of Apple hardware and macOS. It enables creation of macOS VMs and integrates well with existing container based DevOps workflows for iOS and native app build & test CI/CD/automation.

Built on the native Apple hypervisor, it utilizes macOS resource scheduling, performance management, and flexibility. Management of VMs is performed with the Anka Virtualization CLI, UI app, and Build Cloud Controller UI and/or REST APIs.
