Veertu's Anka and Build Cloud is a suite of software tools built for small or enterprise level macOS virtualization needs. It enables the creation, storage, and management of macOS virtual machines (VMs), offering a user experience similar to what Docker and Docker Hub provide for container management, but with an added orchestrator component. Anka is specifically designed for DevOps, CI/CD, and Automation teams that need to build and test macOS or iOS applications.

Anka is a mature and battle-tested solution for small or large-scale macOS virtualization. Leveraging a combination of custom and Apple hypervisor/virtualization technology, Anka offers enhanced performance and security. It provides a simple CLI for generating Anka macOS VMs as well as tools like [Packer](https://github.com/veertuinc/packer-plugin-veertu-anka). You can then manage the VMs as Templates/Tags in the Anka Registry (part of the Anka Build Cloud) and push/pull to and from hosts in your macOS cluster.

Alongside of the Anka Virtualization CLI is the [Anka Build Cloud]({{< relref "../../anka-build-cloud/_index.md" >}}) which serves as a unified management interface for Anka Build Nodes, VM Templates/Tags, VM instances, and logs. It features intelligent queueing and load balancing for handling numerous concurrent CI/CD job macOS VM requests. Additionally, it [integrates with widely-used automation platforms and tools]({{< relref "plugins-and-integrations/_index.md" >}}) such as [Jenkins]({{< relref "plugins-and-integrations/controller-+-registry/jenkins.md" >}}), [Github Actions]({{< relref "plugins-and-integrations/controller-+-registry/github-actions.md" >}}), [Buildkite]({{< relref "plugins-and-integrations/controller-less/buildkite.md" >}}), [TeamCity]({{< relref "plugins-and-integrations/controller-+-registry/teamcity.md" >}}), [GitLab]({{< relref "plugins-and-integrations/controller-+-registry/gitlab-custom-executor.md" >}}), and provides an [API for custom integrations]({{< relref "anka-build-cloud/working-with-controller-and-api.md" >}}).

Anka is a robust and adaptable macOS virtualization platform that can enhance your DevOps and iOS CI/CD/Automation. It is straightforward to use and customize, and offers a broad array of features and capabilities.
