#### Groups + Group Permissions

{{< hint warning >}}
Do not confuse Node Groups with Groups/Group Permissions.
{{< /hint >}}

Under the Permissions section of the Controller UI (`https://<controller address>/#/permission-groups`), let's create a group for our nodes to be able to connect.

1. First choose the Controller Component from the drop down.

{{< imgwithlink src="images/anka-build-cloud/advanced-security-features/perm-groups-choose-component.png" >}}

2. Next, create a new group named `node` by clicking the [+] button.

3. You can now target and add specific **Permissions** or **Resources** for the Group. Click the circular (üíª) icon on the right to highlight what permission should be set for Nodes to communicate with the Controller. Then check/enable the highlighted permissions and click Save Permissions at the bottom of the page. *Important:* Finally, do the same but under the Registry Component.

{{< hint warning >}}
Note: We'll *not* be setting **Resources** right now.
{{< /hint >}}

{{< imgwithlink src="images/anka-build-cloud/advanced-security-features/perm-groups-highlight-node-perms.png" >}}
{{< imgwithlink src="images/anka-build-cloud/advanced-security-features/perm-groups-set-perms.png" >}}

4. The group can now be attached to a specific [Authentication Credential]({{< relref "anka-build-cloud/Advanced Security Features/_index.md#authentication" >}}) and the credential used to access and perform the permitted actions. For example, create a [UAK]({{< relref "anka-build-cloud/Advanced Security Features/uak-tap-authentication.md" >}}) and attach the group.

{{< hint info >}}
Be sure to download the key if you're creating a new UAK.
{{< /hint >}}

{{< rawhtml >}}<center>{{< /rawhtml >}}
{{< imgwithlink src="images/anka-build-cloud/advanced-security-features/perm-groups-set-group-on-uak.png" >}}
{{< rawhtml >}}</center>{{< /rawhtml >}}

You will now see the UAK in the list.

{{< rawhtml >}}<center>{{< /rawhtml >}}
{{< imgwithlink src="images/anka-build-cloud/advanced-security-features/perm-groups-uak-list.png" >}}
{{< rawhtml >}}</center>{{< /rawhtml >}}

The node certificate now has permissions to perform the specifically set actions against all Resources (if Resource Management is disabled).

5. You can now try joining the node to the Controller using the UAK and confirm it's all joined by checking the Controller Nodes page, or the agent logs.

```bash
‚ùØ sudo ankacluster join http://anka.controller:8090 --api-key-file ~/node.cer --api-key-id "node"
Testing connection to the controller...: Ok
Testing connection to the registry...: Ok
Success!
Anka Cloud Cluster join success
```
