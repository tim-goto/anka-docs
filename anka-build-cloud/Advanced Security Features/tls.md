## Requirements

1. A Root CA certificate. For more information about CAs, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority. Usually provided by your organization or where you obtain your certificate signing. We will generate a self-signed one in this guide and refer to this as **anka-ca-crt.pem** and **anka-ca-key.pem**.
