  How to join your Anka Build Virtualization Nodes to the Anka Build Cloud Controller

## Preparing your Nodes

Once the Anka Build Virtualization software has been installed onto a macOS machine, you'll want to turn off sleep and several other default features that would cause the machine to become unavailable.

{{< hint warning >}}
This guide has a few options that are typically not available on MDM controlled machines. You may need to ask your system administrators/local IT team to allow them.
{{< /hint >}}

{{< hint warning >}}
Be sure to reboot the host after applying these changes.
{{< /hint >}}

### Required

1. **Start a UI session by logging into your node's user** to ensure Apple's services are started (it doesn't have to be an administrator).

2. **Ensure you uncheck `Log out after X minutes of inactivity`** under System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Advanced (disabled by default, but good to check)

3. Disable screensaver and sleep: `sudo systemsetup -setsleep Never && sudo defaults write com.apple.screensaver idleTime 0`

4. Run `anka create test && anka delete --yes test` at least once for both root and non-root users to create the necessary folders and garbage collect temporary files.

### Optional but recommended

- **Enable `Automatic Login` for the current user:** Go to Preferences > Users > Enable Automatic Login for the current user. Or, [using the CLI](https://github.com/veertuinc/kcpassword).
  {{< hint warning >}}
  Not available if FileVault is enabled or you use an iCloud password to log into the user.
  {{< /hint >}}
  {{< hint info >}}
  If using the CLI method of enabling `Automatic Login`, you must also XOR-encrypt the login password and add it to `/etc/kcpassword`.

  The `/etc/kcpassword` file must be owned by `root:wheel` with a mode of `0600`.

  See the GitHub repository [veertuinc/kcpassword](https://github.com/veertuinc/kcpassword) for help generating the encrypted password string.
  {{< /hint >}}

- If on macOS version Big Sur: Disable Apple's mitigations with `sudo anka config vmx_mitigations 0`. Without it, performance will be ~10% worse inside of the VM. (This does not work on Monterey versions of macOS)

- Disable spotlight on the host and also inside of the VM:

    If you cannot perform launchctl commands, you can execute these commands from the command-line:

    ```shell
    sudo defaults write ~/.Spotlight-V100/VolumeConfiguration.plist Exclusions -array "/Volumes"
    sudo defaults write ~/.Spotlight-V100/VolumeConfiguration.plist Exclusions -array "/Network"
    sudo killall mds || true
    sleep 60
    sudo mdutil -a -i off /
    sudo mdutil -a -i off
    sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist
    sudo rm -rf /.Spotlight-V100/*
    ```

    MDS can be disable entirely with `sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.metadata.mds.plist`, but only if SIP is disabled on the host (not recommended).

{{< hint info >}}
You may also want to have your nodes restart on host level failure: `systemsetup -setrestartpowerfailure on` & `systemsetup -setrestartfreeze on`
{{< /hint >}}

## Joining Prerequisites

- [Anka Build Cloud Controller should be configured and running before your Anka Node can join.]({{< relref "Anka Build Cloud/_index.md" >}})

- [Your Node should be licensed.]({{< relref "Licensing/_index.md" >}})

- [Your Node should be prepared for high availability.]({{< relref "#preparing-your-nodes" >}})

## Joining to your Anka Build Cloud Controller

{{< hint warning >}}
Be sure to run ankacluster as root.
{{< /hint >}}

{{< hint warning >}}
Avoid using underscores in your domainnames/urls.

```shell
❯ sudo ankacluster join http://anka.controller
Testing connection to the controller...: Ok
Testing connection to the registry...: Ok
Success!
Anka Cloud Cluster join success
```

> You can join a Node to multiple controllers by comma separating them:
> `sudo ankacluster join http://anka.controller1,http://anka.controller2`

```shell
❯ ankacluster join --help
Joins the current machine to one or many Anka Build Cloud Controllers

Usage:
  ankacluster join CONTROLLER_ADDRESS[,CONTROLLER_ADDRESS2] [flags]

      --api-key-string string       API Key string
  -c, --cacert string               Specify the path to your Root CA Certificate (PEM/X509)
  -M, --capacity-mode string        Set the capacity mode (resource or number) the Node will use when pulling jobs from the Anka Cloud Cluster queue. 'resource' will look at available resources (see --vcp-override and --ram-override) / 'number' will only accept if --max-vm-count isn't already met (default "number")
  -C, --cert string                 Specify the path to the Node's certificate file (PEM/X509)

  -f, --force-no-sudo               Force the anka_agent to start without sudo
  -g, --global                      DEPRECATED! Install agent into system domain

  -V, --vcpu-override int           Set the max vcpus that this Node can handle. (default: {current physical cpu count} * 2)
      --vm-stuck-delay duration     The time between unresponsive VM checks (default: 30s - Duration examples: 3500s, 20m, 5h)

{{< hint info >}}
The Anka agent is listening on a socket to provide status information at runtime.
You can override the path of the socket by setting the `ANKA_AGENT_SOCKET` env var.

### Joining as a non-sudo user

It is also possible to join without needing `sudo`. However, as of right now, this has a problems you need to consider:

1. When you upgrade the Anka Build Controller software, there is an automatic agent update triggered for each one of your Anka Nodes. This agent communicates with the Controller to pick up tasks from the queue. Since Apple's `installer` command requires root, this process will not work when running the agent as a non-sudo user. The solution is to disjoin nodes before upgrading your Build Cloud and then issue `curl -O http://**{controllerUrlHere}**/pkg/AnkaAgent.pkg && sudo installer -pkg AnkaAgent.pkg -tgt / ` (`AnkaAgentArm.pkg` if using Anka 3.0) on the nodes after it's running.

To join with a non-sudo user, you simply run `ankacluster join http://anka.controller --force-no-sudo`.

## Disjoining

{{< hint info >}}
You don't need to disjoin nodes to upgrade the Anka Virtualization package.
{{< /hint >}}

```shell
❯ sudo ankacluster disjoin
Disjoined from the Anka Cloud Cluster
```

## Check Join Status

You can check the status of the Anka agent using the `ankacluster status` command.


```shell
❯ ankacluster status
status: running
config:
  vm_limit: 2
  optimization_threshold: 5
  num_workers: 2
  controller_addresses:
  - http://anka.controller.dev
  version: 1.13.0-6cd34a2c
  capacity_mode: number
  heartbeat: 5s
  node_name: MyMacMiniNode
  vm_stuck_check_delay: 30s
  vm_stuck_check_timeout: 10s
```

## Answers to Frequently Asked Questions

- Errors like the following are typically the cause of an older version of the agent on your node. You'll want to visit http://downloads.veertu.com, download the agent version matching your controller's version, and then try your ankacluster join command again:
    ```bash
    > sudo ankacluster join http://anka.controller --reserve-space 20GB
    Testing connection to controller...: Ok
    Testing connection to the registry...: Ok
    Ok
    exit status 2

- The Controller will be checking disk space on every pull/preparation of a VM. If not enough disk space is available, it will automatically delete VM Templates/tags from the Node based on **which has the oldest last used timestamp** until there is enough space for the VM Template/Tag. This cannot be disabled at the moment. This can be modified to some extent by using --reserve-space flag (see explanation above)
- The registry `External URL` (seen in the controller UI/config) is used by the Nodes to pull down templates and tags. Be sure to set this URL properly in your Build Cloud Configuration and ensure firewalls allow communication.
